ProBank ATM System

Overview

ProBank ATM System is a Python-based console application simulating a banking ATM. It allows users to create accounts, authenticate, check balances, deposit, withdraw, change PINs, and delete accounts. Data is stored persistently in a JSON file (accounts.json). The system is designed to be simple, secure, and extensible, making it ideal for demonstrating banking system functionality.
